Clear spirits, i need no greater proof
The proof of me is you
I'm swallowing the evidence it's the only thing to do

Everything they did to build this pyramid
All the souls who died you could see 'em in the pharaoh's eyes
With a far away gaze written on his face
Mistakes some day they'll make him live with that

I am dead and i am buried
And my body is erupting(?)
And the worms they are all feasting on my face and on my fingers
And you laugh as my epitaph gets worn down by the water
Gets worn down by the wind of sons and daughters
As to lies within(?)

The tremors started gently but then the city shakes
First we lost grand central soon the rest fell in its wake
The bridge and tunnels all collapsed
It took us days to build a raft
From metro cars and deli bands(?)
We portish(?) up to hackensack

Central park seems like a dream to me now

Clear spirits, i need no greater proof
The proof of me is you
I'm swallowing the evidence it's the only thing to do

There's a brass band playin' while i'm
Selling my soul to satan
Hands thrown up in the air
Cuz we, like, just don't care (sing it like a valley girl)
