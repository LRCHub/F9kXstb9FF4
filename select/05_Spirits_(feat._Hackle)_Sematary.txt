(There are spirit's in this house)
(I can see your soul at the
Edges of your eyes it's corrosive
Like acid) yeah
Haunted Mound i'm a Haunted Mound cowboy
(i'll see you again) hauugghhhh
Spirit's follow me everywhere I go
You can try the Haunted Mound
Our cutters be up
I got a bad bitch from Argentinia
Wire bat on me, turn ya to spirit orb
Spirit's follow me everywhere I go
Shakin' doors
Breakin' windows in my butcher house
I talk to my shadow
When I look ya in your eyes
I can see your soul
Well, I'm a Haunted Mound cowboy
Real cowboys, we'll put ya in your tombstone
Thеre's spirit's in my house
Swear I'm not off Bеnadryl, I can hear 'em
Screaming Forest where the wind cries
Whisper to me like a jack-o lantern
Buck buck like my sawed-off
Walk, walk up in my house, call the coroner
I told you I was sick
She say she love me, but I'm a haunted house
Boomstick like Ash Williams mark 'em dead
Send 'em up with the spirit's
Spirit's follow me everywhere I go
You can try the Haunted Mound
Our cutters be up
I got a bad bitch from Argentinia
Wire bat on me, turn ya to spirit orb
Spirit's follow me everywhere I go
Shakin' doors
Breakin' windows in my butcher house
I talk to my shadow
When I look ya in your eyes
I can see your soul (Hackle down on 'em)
Come and meet my AK, he be takin' souls
Grave Man smokin' packs, he on a roll
We don't give a fuck, we'll take you out
Lotta guns, lotta knives in the butcher house
Run up, we'll turn you to a spirit
Take you where the trees all screamin'
We gon' skin you, make sure that you feel it
Hackle down on 'em, you cannot forgive me
Spirit's follow me everywhere I go
You can try the Haunted Mound
Our cutters be up
I got a bad bitch from Argentinia
Wire bat on me, turn ya to spirit orb
Spirit's follow me everywhere I go
Shakin' doors
Breakin' windows in my butcher house
I talk to my shadow
When I look ya in your eyes
I can see your soul
