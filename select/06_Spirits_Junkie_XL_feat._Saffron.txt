Junkie XL is in the house

So you wanna play games, sweetie
You think you're such a smooth operator
You're tempted by fame
And you think my bark is worse than my bite

Your breath smells like sulfur
Remember your the dancing cougar
I wouldn't want you conquered
You'll tumble all again, you're so far

'Cause I got friends in high places
Don't cross 'em that's a chance you've taken
I got friends in all the right places
Listen, look behind 'cause they're coming for you

Don't twist my good nature, not my fault
You can look in the mirror, you laugh like a hyena
Listen up 'cause you don't wanna mess with me
They're after you, they're coming for you, now I've got enough

'Cause I got friends in high places
Wouldn't cross them, that's a chance you're taking
I got friends in all the right places
Better look behind 'cause they're watching you

'Cause I got friends in high places
Don't cross 'em that's a chance you've taken
I got friends in all the right places
Listen, look behind 'cause they're coming for you

They're after you, they're coming for you

So you wanna play games, sweetie
You think you're such a smooth operator
You're tempted by fame
And you think my bark is worse than my bite

Your breath smells like sulfur

I wouldn't want you conquered
Your tumble will only get you so far

Listen up 'cause you don't wanna mess with me

'Cause I got friends in high places
Don't cross 'em that's a chance you're taking
I got friends in all the right places
Better look behind 'cause they're coming for you

'Cause I got friends in high places
