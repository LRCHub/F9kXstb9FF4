I'm talking about the Spirit!

The spirit's in it whoo!
Let everybody know about
The spirit's in it
And it won't let you go

So stop
Stop the moment
I got a better idea
Let's get together
Get together someway

The spirit's in it
You can't say you don't know
The spirit's in it
Boy it won't let you go

So stop
Stop this second
Let me suggest to you
That we can do better
Better in time

We can do, we can do, we can do
Better
Can try

The spirit's in it
When you can't find it no more
The spirit's in it
Let it open and shut door

So listen
To me people
Get control of yourself
Let's get together
And work things out

The spirit's in it
There's no need to go higher
The spirit's in it
Can't you hear it testifying
Let's work everybody
You're leaving me out
Let's get together
And work it out

Work it out
With the Almighty
Got you, got you, got you
