(originally by David Bowie)
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Nothing could keep us together
We could beat them just for one day
Yeah, we can be heroes just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, that is a fact
Ooh, yes, we're lovers, that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could beat them just for one day
We can be heroes, forever and ever
What d'you say?
Oh I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like the dolphins can swim
Though nothing will drive them away
We could beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day
And I, I will be king
And you would be my queen
Nothing would keep us together
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame, it fell on the other side
Oh, we could beat them just for one day
And we would be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
No, nothing would keep us together
Oh, maybe we're lying, well then you better not stay
We could be heroes just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, we could be heroes
Oh-oh-oh-oh, just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, just for one day
